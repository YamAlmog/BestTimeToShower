# BestTimeToShower
This project exports an API to get the best time to shower based on 'Pikud Haoref' alrets history at your location.
You can also get the worst time to shower, the most hitted settlement and other features. 

I collected and indexed real historical alerts data obtained from 'Pikud Haoref' API, and stored it in a PostgreSQL database.


## How to run?
docker-compose up --build
