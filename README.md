# BestTimeToShower
This project exports an API to get the best time to shower based on 'Pikud Haoref' alrets history at your location.
You can also get the worst time to shower, the most bombed settlement and other features. 

I collected and indexed real historical alerts data obtained from the
'Pikud Haoref' API, and stored it in a PostgreSQL database.


To run it on docker use this command:
docker-compose up --build
